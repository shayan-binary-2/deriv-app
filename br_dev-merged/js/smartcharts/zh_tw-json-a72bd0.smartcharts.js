The Alligator is as much a metaphor as it is an indicator. It consists of three lines, overlaid on a pricing chart, that represent the jaw, the teeth and the lips of the beast, and was created to help the trader confirm the presence of a trend and its direction. The Alligator indicator can also help traders designate impulse and corrective wave formations, but the tool works best when combined with a momentum indicator.":"","Bollinger Bands can be used to measure the highness or lowness of the price relative to previous trades.":"","Box Size":"箱尺寸","Cancel":"取消","Candle":"蠟燭線","Channel [num]":"","Chart data is not available for this symbol.":"此符號不可用於圖表資料。","Chart types":"圖表類型","Charts":"圖表","Clear all":"全部清除","CLOSE":"關","CLOSED":"已關閉","Color":"顏色","Comparison":"比較","Continuous":"連續線","Continuous [num]":"","CSV":"CSV","Dark":"深色","day":"天","Day":"天","days":"天","Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.

There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low.":"","Display data for a specific date and time":"顯示特定日期和時間的資料","Display remaining time for each interval":"顯示每個間隔的剩餘時間","Display the highest and lowest spot price":"顯示最高和最低現貨價格","Done":"完成","Download":"下載","Drawing tools":"繪圖工具","Favorites":"我的最愛","Fib Fan [num]":"","Fractals are indicators on candlestick charts that identify reversal points in the market.

Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices of a financial instrument ADX will range between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength.":"","The Awesome Oscillator is an indicator used to measure market momentum. AO calculates the difference of a 34 Period and 5 Period Simple Moving Averages. The Simple Moving Averages that are used are not calculated using closing price but rather each bar\'s midpoints. AO is generally used to affirm trends or to anticipate possible reversals.":"","The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.":"","The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) helps to identify price cycles without the influence of short- and long-term trends. The DPO compares a simple moving average to a historical pricenear the middle of a specified period. It also shows the peaks and drops over that particular period, making it easier to predict buy points.":"","The Donchian Channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods. The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.":"","The Gator Oscillator helps to detect trend changes in the market price. Based on the Alligator indicator, the Gator plots 2 histograms on either side of the zero line. The sleeping phase (absence of a trend) is when the bars on both sides are red. The awakening phase (formation of a trend) is when there are red and green bars on both sides. When there are green bars on both sides, it indicates the eating phase (trend strengthening). A solitary red bar appearing after the eating phase indicates the beginning of the sated phase (trend approaching its end).":"","The Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile indicator that defines support and resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum and provides trading signals. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into “one look equilibrium chart”.":"","The Moving Average (MA) helps to identify the overall market trend by filtering out short-term price fluctuations. Using historical data, it calculates the average price over a specific period and plots a line on the chart. If the MA line moves upwards, it’s an indicator of an uptrend, a downtrend if it moves downwards. A buy signal occurs when the price moves above the MA line.":"","The Moving Average Envelope (MAE) helps to identify strong price movement that indicates the start of a trend. The MAE creates a moving average line as well as 2 bands around it. In theory, when the market price touches the upper or lower bands, a trend reversal will occur, indicating a buy signal.":"","The parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR emerges below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR emerges above the price and converges downwards. At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance.":"","The Price Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator displays the difference between the current price and the price x-time periods ago. The difference can be displayed in either points or as a percentage.":"","The Rainbow Moving Average (RMA) displays several moving average lines simultaneously. When the lines intersect, it’s an indicator of price reversal and the angle of the lines are helpful to predict the trend strength. The steeper the curve, the stronger the trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from below, it signals an upward trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from above, it signals a downward trend. The RMA is easier to use compared to using several different moving average indicators at once.":"","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was published by J. Welles Wilder. The current price is normalized as a percentage between 0 and 100. The name of this oscillator is misleading because it does not compare the instrument relative to another instrument or set of instruments, but rather represents the current price relative to other recent pieces within the selected lookback window length.":"","The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) helps to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market and to predict bearish or bullish trends. It calculates the distance between the current closing price and the median of the high/low range, and displays 2 lines on the chart: the first (known as %K) represents the price movement while the second (known as %D) is a moving average of the first line. If the closing price is higher than the median of the high/low range, the SMI returns a positive value. If the closing price is lower than the average price, a negative value is returned. Values above 40 indicate a bullish trend while values below -40 indicate a bearish trend.":"","Themes":"主題","There are no active comparisons yet.":"還沒有任何激活比較。","There are no favorites yet.":"還沒有偏好。","tick":"跳動點","Tick":"跳動點","Tick interval only available for \\\\\\"Area\\\\\\" Chart type.":"跳動點間隔僅適用於 \\\\\\"面積\\\\\\"圖表類型。","Time interval":"時間間隔","Trend [num]":"","Try checking your spelling or use a different term":"嘗試檢查拼寫或使用其他字詞","Underlying Assets":"標的資產","Up to 5 active indicators allowed.":"可同時使用多達5個活動指示器。","Vertical [num]":"","Would you like to overwrite it?":"是否要覆蓋它？","You have no active drawings yet.":"還沒有任何激活圖形。","You have no active indicators yet.":"還沒有任何激活指標。","You have no saved templates yet.":"您尚未儲存任何範本。","Zig Zag helps to identify trend reversals and filters out relatively small price movements by determining the support and resistance levels of the market.
