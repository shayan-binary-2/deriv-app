The chart's y-axis smoothly expands/contracts when a new high or low is reached\n *\n * The following chart types are supported: line, mountain, baseline_delta.\n *\n * Chart aggregations such as Kagi, Renko, Range Bars, etc. are not supported.\n *\n * **Animation displays more gracefully when updates are sent into the chart one at a time using {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#updateChartData}\n * instead of in batches using a [QuoteFeed]{@link CIQ.ChartEngine#attachQuoteFeed}.

The larger the number the smaller the price jump between frames, which is good for charts that need a very slow smooth animation either because the price jumps between ticks are very small, or because the animation was set up to run over a large number of frames when instantiating the CIQ.EaseMachine.\n * @param {number} [animationParameters.tension=null] Splining tension for smooth curves around data points (range 0-1).
