The Alligator is as much a metaphor as it is an indicator. It consists of three lines, overlaid on a pricing chart, that represent the jaw, the teeth and the lips of the beast, and was created to help the trader confirm the presence of a trend and its direction. The Alligator indicator can also help traders designate impulse and corrective wave formations, but the tool works best when combined with a momentum indicator.":"","Bollinger Bands can be used to measure the highness or lowness of the price relative to previous trades.":"","Box Size":"Tamaño de la caja","Cancel":"Cancelar","Candle":"Vela","Channel [num]":"","Chart data is not available for this symbol.":"Los datos del gráfico no están disponibles para este símbolo.","Chart types":"Tipos de gráficos","Charts":"Gráficos","Clear all":"Vaciar todo","CLOSE":"CERRAR","CLOSED":"CERRADO","Color":"Color","Comparison":"Comparación","Continuous":"Continuo","Continuous [num]":"","CSV":"CSV","Dark":"Oscuro","day":"día","Day":"Día","days":"días","Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator.

There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low.":"","Display data for a specific date and time":"Mostrar datos para una fecha y hora específicas","Display remaining time for each interval":"Mostrar el tiempo restante para cada intervalo","Display the highest and lowest spot price":"Mostrar el precio spot más alto y más bajo","Done":"Finalizado","Download":"Descargar","Drawing tools":"Herramientas para dibujar","Favorites":"Favoritos","Fib Fan [num]":"","Fractals are indicators on candlestick charts that identify reversal points in the market.

Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices of a financial instrument ADX will range between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength.":"","The Awesome Oscillator is an indicator used to measure market momentum. AO calculates the difference of a 34 Period and 5 Period Simple Moving Averages. The Simple Moving Averages that are used are not calculated using closing price but rather each bar\'s midpoints. AO is generally used to affirm trends or to anticipate possible reversals.":"","The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.":"","The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) helps to identify price cycles without the influence of short- and long-term trends. The DPO compares a simple moving average to a historical pricenear the middle of a specified period. It also shows the peaks and drops over that particular period, making it easier to predict buy points.":"","The Donchian Channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking the highest high and the lowest low of the last n periods. The area between the high and the low is the channel for the period chosen.":"","The Gator Oscillator helps to detect trend changes in the market price. Based on the Alligator indicator, the Gator plots 2 histograms on either side of the zero line. The sleeping phase (absence of a trend) is when the bars on both sides are red. The awakening phase (formation of a trend) is when there are red and green bars on both sides. When there are green bars on both sides, it indicates the eating phase (trend strengthening). A solitary red bar appearing after the eating phase indicates the beginning of the sated phase (trend approaching its end).":"","The Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile indicator that defines support and resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum and provides trading signals. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into “one look equilibrium chart”.":"","The Moving Average (MA) helps to identify the overall market trend by filtering out short-term price fluctuations. Using historical data, it calculates the average price over a specific period and plots a line on the chart. If the MA line moves upwards, it’s an indicator of an uptrend, a downtrend if it moves downwards. A buy signal occurs when the price moves above the MA line.":"","The Moving Average Envelope (MAE) helps to identify strong price movement that indicates the start of a trend. The MAE creates a moving average line as well as 2 bands around it. In theory, when the market price touches the upper or lower bands, a trend reversal will occur, indicating a buy signal.":"","The parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend, the SAR emerges below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR emerges above the price and converges downwards. At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated one period in advance.":"","The Price Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator displays the difference between the current price and the price x-time periods ago. The difference can be displayed in either points or as a percentage.":"","The Rainbow Moving Average (RMA) displays several moving average lines simultaneously. When the lines intersect, it’s an indicator of price reversal and the angle of the lines are helpful to predict the trend strength. The steeper the curve, the stronger the trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from below, it signals an upward trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from above, it signals a downward trend. The RMA is easier to use compared to using several different moving average indicators at once.":"","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was published by J. Welles Wilder. The current price is normalized as a percentage between 0 and 100. The name of this oscillator is misleading because it does not compare the instrument relative to another instrument or set of instruments, but rather represents the current price relative to other recent pieces within the selected lookback window length.":"","The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) helps to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market and to predict bearish or bullish trends. It calculates the distance between the current closing price and the median of the high/low range, and displays 2 lines on the chart: the first (known as %K) represents the price movement while the second (known as %D) is a moving average of the first line. If the closing price is higher than the median of the high/low range, the SMI returns a positive value. If the closing price is lower than the average price, a negative value is returned. Values above 40 indicate a bullish trend while values below -40 indicate a bearish trend.":"","Themes":"Temas","There are no active comparisons yet.":"No hay comparaciones activas cargadas.","There are no favorites yet.":"No hay favoritos cargados.","tick":"tick","Tick":"Tick","Tick interval only available for \\\\\\"Area\\\\\\" Chart type.":"El intervalo de tick solo está disponible para el tipo de gráfico \\\\\\"Área\\\\\\".","Time interval":"Intervalo de tiempo","Trend [num]":"","Try checking your spelling or use a different term":"Intente revisar su ortografía o use un término diferente","Underlying Assets":"Activos Subyacentes","Up to 5 active indicators allowed.":"Hasta 5 indicadores activos permitidos.","Vertical [num]":"","Would you like to overwrite it?":"¿Desee sobre-escribirlo?","You have no active drawings yet.":"Aún no tiene dibujos activos.","You have no active indicators yet.":"Aún no tiene indicadores activos.","You have no saved templates yet.":"Aún no tiene plantillas guardadas.","Zig Zag helps to identify trend reversals and filters out relatively small price movements by determining the support and resistance levels of the market.
